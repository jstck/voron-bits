# BLTouch mount

These are a couple iterations of a bracket to mount a [BLTouch probe](https://www.antclabs.com/bltouch-v3) to [this carriage](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2406521) in place of one of the parts cooling fans. Can easily be adjusted in height and width for the appropriate z offset and clearance for the hotend.
