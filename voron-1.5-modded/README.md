# Modified original parts

These are modified parts from the original [Voron 1.5](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-1/tree/Voron1.5/STLs/VORON1.5), released under the [same license](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-1/blob/Voron1.5/LICENSE.md).


## Idler brackets
These are idler brackets for the Voron 1.5 (using flanged bearings).
This is a simple modification where the screw holes for the idler shafts are through holes so slightly longer screws will fit.

## J-head hotend mount
Initially I used a leftover J-head. These are modifications to the original hotend retainer, with slightly different dimensions.
